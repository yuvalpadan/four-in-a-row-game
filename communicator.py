    can be anticipated (after an initial connection has been created) and
    acted upon. The initial connection needs to be explicitly created by
    invoking connect(), which attempts establishment in a non blocking way.

    # low value to create a connection "chance" (will
    # not happen if simply set to non blocking), but
