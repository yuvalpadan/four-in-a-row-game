We used open-source information in ordrer to learn about Tkinter library
and maximize the game graphics:

Description: This exercise implements the "Four In A Row" game,
using Tkinter library.
===============================================================

Files included in this exercise:

1. board:
   In this file we defined a Board class. Every object from this class
   represents the board of "four in a row" game.

2. game:
   In this file we defined a Game class. Every object from this class
   represents a game of "four in a row".

3. four_in_a_row:
   In this file we defined a FourInARow class. Every object from this class
   represents a game of "four in a row" with graphics using Tkinter library.

4. communicator:
   In this file the Communicator class is defined. Using the socket library,
   this object allows playing the game with two players that are on the same
   network. The players communicate through messages that are interperated
   to actions.

5. ai:
   In this file we defined an AI class. Every object from this class
   represents an ai player of "four in a row" game.

6. images:
   This file contains all the images required to initialize FourInARow object.
